      p Hey! I’m Lynn and I’m a designer, CSS developer, and illustrator. I love working on the web and making sure it continues to be a place for everyone and our creative, personal, and weird passions.

      p To that end, I’ve built a collection of weirdly specific projects dedicated to #[a(href='https://airportcod.es') airport codes], #[a(href='https://hollywoodagegap.com') age gaps in film], #[a(href='https://nestflix.fun') fake movies in movies], #[a(href='https://usflags.design') state flags], #[a(href='https://why.az') Arizona], and television shows #[a(href='https://thefoodplace.cafe') The Good Place], #[a(href='https://davidrose.style') Schitt’s Creek], and #[a(href='https://topchefstats.com') Top Chef].

      p I love to experiment with the web as a creative medium. This here portfolio changes #[a(href='/archive') each year] in pursuit of learning and using web technology in unexpected ways. My drawing project, #[a(href='https://a.singlediv.com') A Single Div], explores the artistic power of CSS.

      p My projects have been featured by CNN, NPR, Vox, NET magazine, and Entertainment Weekly.

      p Right now I work with the tiny team at #[a(href='https://ui.dev') ui.dev] from sunny Phoenix, Arizona where I hang with my husband Clay and our pup #[a(href='https://lynnandtonicblog.com/2023/05/03/meet-gravy/') Gravy].

      p I’m a big fan of pop punk, Diet Dr. Pepper, musicals, playing team trivia, and sending care packages in the mail.

      blockquote The word that best describes Lynn is #[em undaunted]. She seems so at home living on the outer bounds of her creative comfort zone that she makes any wild and dangerous frontier look downright cozy.
        cite Adam Avenir

      p If you’d like to support me, sharing my work with your buds is the best way. Means a lot, for real. You can also buy stickers/prints on #[a(href='https://www.etsy.com/shop/lynnandtonic') Etsy] or #[span.coffee #[a(href='https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lynnandtonic') buy me a coffee]].
