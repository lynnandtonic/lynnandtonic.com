        p Lynn Fisher (she/her) is a Busan-born, American artist known for her work on the web. After attending art school in Arizona, she began working as a designer and CSS developer in software consulting.
        p Ever annoyed at being boxed in, she has spent her career pursuing cross-discipline endeavors and filling unconventional roles.
        p In the 2010s, she began experimenting with the web as a creative medium, utilizing established web technologies in new ways. Her annual portfolio refresh gains popularity #[a(href='/archive') each year] as an example of surprising responsive design and her drawing project, #[a(href='https://a.singlediv.com') A Single Div], demonstrates the artistic power of CSS.
        p With the goal of creating special, niche corners of the web, she has built a collection of projects dedicated to #[a(href='https://airportcod.es') airport codes], #[a(href='https://hollywoodagegap.com') age gaps in film], #[a(href='https://nestflix.fun') fake movies in movies], #[a(href='https://usflags.design') state flags], #[a(href='https://why.az') Arizona], and television shows #[a(href='https://thefoodplace.cafe') The Good Place], #[a(href='https://davidrose.style') Schitt’s Creek], and #[a(href='https://topchefstats.com') Top Chef].
        p Her work has been featured by CNN, NPR, Vox, NET magazine, and Entertainment Weekly.
        p She currently works with the tiny team at #[a(href='https://ui.dev') ui.dev] and lives in Phoenix, Arizona with her husband Clay and their two dogs, Boomer and Helo.
